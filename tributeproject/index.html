                <h2>Misile Man Of India</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong)</b>
                    was an
                    Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and
                    nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. His scientific achievements
                    and popularity gained him the epithets “Missile Man” and “People’s President.”
                    Early life and career

                    Kalam was born in a town in Tamil Nadu state to a fishing boat owner from a once wealthy family. The
                    youngest of five siblings, Kalam persevered with his education despite his impoverished
                    circumstances. He earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of
                    Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he
                    moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was project director of the
                    SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. In 1980
                    SLV-III successfully released a satellite called Rohini into near-Earth orbit, taking India’s space
                    program to the international stage. Kalam oversaw further development of launch vehicle technologies
                    at ISRO, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
